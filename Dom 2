Cookies in PHP are a way to store small amounts of data on the clientâ€™s browser. Here's the simplest way to use cookies in PHP:

### **Set a Cookie**
```php
<?php
// Set a cookie named "username" with value "Ravi" that expires in 1 hour
setcookie("username", "Ravi", time() + 3600);

// Check if the cookie is set
if (isset($_COOKIE['username'])) {
    echo "Cookie 'username' is set!";
} else {
    echo "Cookie 'username' is not set.";
}
?>
```

### **Access a Cookie**
```php
<?php
// Check if the cookie exists
if (isset($_COOKIE['username'])) {
    echo "Welcome, " . $_COOKIE['username'];
} else {
    echo "Cookie 'username' is not found!";
}
?>
```

### **Delete a Cookie**
```php
<?php
// Delete the cookie by setting its expiration time in the past
setcookie("username", "", time() - 3600);
echo "Cookie 'username' deleted!";
?>
```

### Key Notes:
1. Use `setcookie()` before any HTML output (it must be called before any `echo` or HTML tag).
2. Cookies are stored as plain text on the client side, so avoid storing sensitive information directly.
3. Always validate or sanitize data from cookies before use.
